# Airdrop Boilerplate

Airdrop Boilerplate provides a minimal set of smart contracts to run a simple ICO flow:
participants deposit ETH into a vault, and later claim their allocated ERC20 tokens through a Merkle treeâ€“based distribution.

It includes:
- A Vault contract to handle ETH contributions, withdrawals, and lifecycle management.
- A Claim contract that verifies Merkle proofs to securely distribute ERC20 tokens to eligible addresses.
- Example mocks (ERC20 and ERC721) for testing and development.
